        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Ella, and live in Brisbane, Queensland, where I grew up. I'm 18, with only very little experience in IT, but I'm very eager to learn.
                </br> I graduated highschool in 2018, and commenced a degree at QUT in 2019, which I did not complete.
                </br> One of my hobbies is, in fact, language learning. However I only speak English proficiently, and I have an intermediate understanding of French. I plan to improve my language skills this year!
            </p>
        <h2>Interest in Information Technology</h2>
            <p>I am interested in IT because I enjoy problem solving and using logic-based thinking skills, but I am also attracted to the creativity that is required in some IT roles.
                My interest in IT started when my Dad suggested I should learn some coding for fun - he currently works as an IT professional as well. 
                My experience is limited to basic html and css courses with online learning platforms such as Codecademy, including making a <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ellamackenzie/google-homepage/blob/master/g-homepage.html">visually identical </a> (but non-functional) version of the Google homepage.
                </br>
