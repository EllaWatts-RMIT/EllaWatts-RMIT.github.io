        <h1>Assignment 1 - My Profile</h1>
        <h3>Name: Ella Watts</br>Student number: s3851446</br>Email: s3851446@student.rmit.edu.au</h3>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Ella, and live in Brisbane, Queensland, where I grew up. I'm 18, with only very little experience in IT, but I'm very eager to learn.
                 I graduated highschool in 2018, and commenced a degree at QUT in 2019, which I did not complete.
                </br></br> One of my hobbies is, in fact, language learning. However, I only speak English proficiently, and I have an intermediate understanding of French. I plan to improve my language skills this year!</p>
        <h2>Interest in Information Technology</h2>
            <p>I am interested in IT because I enjoy problem solving and using logic-based thinking skills, but I am also attracted to the creativity that is required in some IT roles.
                My interest in IT started when my dad suggested I should learn some coding for fun - he currently works as an IT professional as well. 
                My experience is limited to basic html and css courses with online learning platforms such as Codecademy, including making a <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ellamackenzie/google-homepage/blob/master/g-homepage.html">visually identical</a> (but non-functional) version of the Google homepage.
                </br></br> I chose to study with RMIT through Open Universities Australia because I believe that the fully-online learning systems give me the freedom to juggle both my study and work commitments easily. 
                During my studies, I hope to gain some technical skills (especially as much programming knowledge as I can), while also developing an understanding of the many aspects of the industry to help me develop marketable skillsets and find work in the future.</p>
        <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
            <!--p>For me, my ideal job would be employment as a software developer. An example of a job that I have found is a <a href="https://au.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=ea967817f292fa03&tk=1e3mg4evl84sh800&from=serp&vjs=3">Junior Software Developer</a> position for Ampcontrol.
            Ampcontrol is a company who manages safety in mining, renewables and other industrial applications.</p>
            <p>The advertisement mentions two key aspects of the role, which are IoT (Internet of Things) and </p>-->
            <p>For my, my ideal job would be employment as a web developer. 
                An example of a job that I have found is a <a href="https://au.indeed.com/viewjob?cmp=Bliss-Digital&t=Front+End+Developer&jk=ff3aab52d37509fe&sjdu=8EWtruxy728tzxKcUmN0cfOGBUDcSLAVanATIv7U07SSduClHeCX0vREHJGheKQ5a7R8EWrFbdpivPGStvF92A&tk=1e3mh5gur84sh800&adid=342597083&pub=4a1b367933fd867b19b072952f68dceb&vjs=3">Front End Developer</a> position with Bliss Digital.
                The company is a digital agency specializing in user experience and user interface (UX/UI) architecture.</p>
            <p>Being a front-end developer in this situation means creating and managing code that runs the user-facing side of the sites that Bliss Digital is responsible for.
                This is the sort of position that interests me because I enjoy the problem-solving aspect of managing the programming, but I also enjoy the creative aspect that comes with creating the UI and creating good user experience.</p>
            <p>The advertisement stipulates a minimum of three years experience in a similar role, as well as skill in several languages, including HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript and JQUERY. Other requirements include knowledge of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), source control, and Drupal, SilverStripe or Magneto.
                </br></br>HTML and CSS are the some of the most basic building blocks of webpages. 
                Sass (syntactically awesome style sheets) is another style sheet language used to program the appearance of webpages.
                JavaScript is commonly used in webpages to manage the interactive aspects of websites - JQUERY is a JavaScript library. 
                </br></br> WCAG is a series of standards for web accessibility - including guidelines for alternate text for images and designing websites so that screen readers can interpret them, meaning that webpages are accessible to everyone.
                </br></br> Drupal, SilverStripe and Magneto are content management systems, which facillitate cooperative contribution to webpages, especially within an organisation.</p>
            <p>My current skills include very limited HTML, CSS and using github with command line interface. Also my portfolio consists of only one extremely basic webpage. 
                In order to qualify for this position or similar, I will continue to simultaneously gain skills and build a portfolio by working on web design projects. I would like to prioritise finding collaborative work or projects,
                so that I gain experience working in a team and working with content management systems. Another option that I have is to enroll myself in some courses teaching skills such as web design or, more specifically, JavaScript,
                to gain the skills necessary to start a project. 
            </p>
